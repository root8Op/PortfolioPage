            <h1>HARSHIT GUPTA</h1>
            <P>I used to enjoy complexions and working hard for my profession.
                I also love the logic and structure of coding and 
                always strive to write elegant and efficent code, whether it be HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                When I'm not codding, you'll find me learning something new, training or analyzing.</P>
